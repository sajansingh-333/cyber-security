E.g. Computer virus, malware or flooding of requests to the server by a bot.

Threat
Threat is any potential danger that is associated with the exploitation of a vulnerability. A threat is an undesirable event that can happen to assets.

E.g. An organization running on windows operating system was targeted and blocked until a ransom of $300 was credited to hackers account to unlock the data. Threat here is the leak of data.
